# Module 10 Challenge

### SQLAlchemy Challenge

Assignment Submission by: Andrea Aguilar


In this assignment, we used Python and SQLAlchemy to analyze and visualize climate data from a SQLite database. Aditionally, we designed a Flask API to make the climate data analysis accessible through various routes, enabling users to retrieve precipitation, stations, and temperature data as requested.
