# Climate SQLAlchemy Analysis

## Overview 
In this assignment, we used Python and SQLAlchemy to analyze and visualize climate data from a SQLite database. Aditionally, we designed a Flask API to make the climate data analysis accessible through various routes, enabling users to retrieve precipitation, stations, and temperature data as requested. 

## Languages/ Tools 
- SQLAlchemy
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Flask
